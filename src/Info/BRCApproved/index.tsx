          (BRC), established in 1964, is a national focus in the UK for
          terrestrial and freshwater species recording. BRC works closely with
          the voluntary recording community, principally through support of
          national recording schemes and societies. BRC is supported by the
          Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and the UK Centre for
          Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH). The work of BRC is a major component of
          the National Biodiversity Network (NBN).

            BRC apps

          feature some of the same species? We have introduced the BRC Approved
          logo to signify that data from our apps all go to the same place.
          Therefore, you are free to choose which app you use to record a given
          species. All records will be sent to the same place, treated in the
          same way and will meet the established standards required by the
          Biological Record Centre.
